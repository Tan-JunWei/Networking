Next Hop

Task
A to B
Fill in the table below with the source and destination IP and MAC addresses at each hop as a 
packet is sent from device A to device B.


| Hop    | Source IP        | Destination IP | Source MAC        | Destination MAC   |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1      |  192.168.1.100   |  192.168.2.200 | 52:1a:7f:9b:3e:cd | 00:11:22:33:44:55 |
| 2      |  192.168.1.100   |  192.168.2.200 | 00:11:22:33:44:55 | 00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee |
| 3      |  192.168.1.100   |  192.168.2.200 | 00:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee | ac:de:48:8b:9f:c2 |




B to A
Now B sends a reply packet back to A. Fill in the table below with the source and destination IP and 
MAC addresses at each hop as a packet is sent from device B to device A.

| Hop    | Source IP        | Destination IP | Source MAC        | Destination MAC   |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1      |  192.168.2.200   |  192.168.1.100 | ac:de:48:8b:9f:c2 | 00:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa |
| 2      |  192.168.2.200   |  192.168.1.100 | 00:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa | 00:55:44:33:22:11 |
| 3      |  192.168.2.200   |  192.168.1.100 | 00:55:44:33:22:11 | 52:1a:7f:9b:3e:cd |


Explanation of why addresses change/ do not change at each hop

The IP addresses remain the same at each hop, since the source and destination IP addresses of the device remains the same. 

The MAC addresses change at each hop as the packet is transmitted from one device to another, with each device having a unique MAC address. At each device, the next corresponding MAC address is updated for the packet to be transmitted to that specific MAC address.
