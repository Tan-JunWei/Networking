3. Answer the following questions:
What is the purpose of an ARP request?
It requests for the MAC address associated with the target IP address.

What is the purpose of an ARP reply?
It is a response to an ARP request, containing the MAC address of the device associated with the IP address stated in the request.

What's the difference between the Destination MAC address in ARP replies and ARP requests? Why is 
that?
The destination MAC address in ARP replies is the MAC address of the device that sent the ARP request. However, the destination MAC address in the ARP request is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, which is the broadcast MAC address. This specifies that this packet is sent to all devices on the network.

For the last packet - why do you think there is no ARP reply for this request? Try to give several 
possible reasons, based on what you see.
