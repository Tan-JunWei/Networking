Instructions
For each packet in the packet flow, determine which ports on Swift and Taylor the packet will be 
sent to based on their current switching tables. Fill in the table below, indicating the port 
number(s) or "Broadcast" if the packet is broadcast to all ports except the one on which it was received.


| Packet | Swift Port(s)    | Taylor Port(s) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 1      | P2               | -              |
| 2      | P1               | -              |
| 3      | P4               | P2             |
| 4      | -                | P4             |
| 5      | P4               | P3             |
| 6      | P1, P2, P4       | P2, P3, P4     |
| 7      | P1               | P4             |
