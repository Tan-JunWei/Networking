Step 1 - Desktop Mode
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0

The portion that identifies my device type is: X11; Linux x86_64

Step 2 - Mobile Mode
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; SAMSUNG SM-G973U) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) SamsungBrowser/14.2 Chrome/87.0.4280.141 Mobile Safari/537.36\r\n

The portion that identifies my device type is: Android 11; SAMSUNG SM-G973U

The main difference between this one and the earlier one (captured desktop mode vs mobile mode) is:
The User-Agent in Mobile Mode identifies the device type as a Samsung mobile phone device, as opposed to a Linux computer.

The differences in the User-Agent strings reflect the different environments of desktop and mobile devices. 
Desktops are designed for larger displays and higher processing power, while mobile browsers are optimized for smaller screens and touch input.
