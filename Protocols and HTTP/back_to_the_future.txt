Command used:
echo -e "GET /hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: info.cern.ch\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc -v info.cern.ch 80

For some reason, nc kept automatically submitting my unfinished HTTP request, causing me to receive a 400 Bad Request Status Code 
repeatedly, hence I used echo to submit the HTTP request instead.

After copying the HTML content into notepad and saving it as cern.html, I was able to see the homepage of the WWW project.

As tasked, when I tried to access https://info.cern.ch/notexisting using Netcat, I received the 404 Not Found Status Code. 
This is because this page does not exist on the server, and thus is unable to be fetched.
