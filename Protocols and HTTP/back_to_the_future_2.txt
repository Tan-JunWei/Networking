Task 1: Inspect HTTP Headers

I was able to recognise familiar information. For example, I was able to identify the GET request method, the URL and a Status Code of 
304 Not Modified.

The 'Accept' header under Request Headers shares information and preferences about the client requesting for a service from the server. 
It can help the server tailor the response that will eventually be sent to the client.

Task 2: Manipulate the html

I think browsers allow users to change the page easily to allow them to adjust how the elements are displayed according to their liking and preferences.
This introduces a layer of flexibility instead of rigidity that can be helpful for accessibility or convenience (changing size of elements, etc).
