Part 1: Status Line

Component: HTTP/1.1
Meaning: Version of HTTP Protocol used in the communication
Component: 200 OK
Meaning: Successful response status code that indicates a request has succeeded

Part 2: Headers
"Content-Type:" (Header) Purpose: Informs the client about the media type of the returned data.
"Server:" (Header) Purpose: Indicates the software used by the origin server that handled the request and generated a response.
"Content-Length:" (Header) Purpose: Indicates the size of the response data in bytes.

Why does the browser need Content-Type and Content-Length?
The browser requires the Content-Type to handle and process the content correctly. The Content-Length helps the browser to know how much data to expect.

As cyber security researchers, how can the server header help us (or help potential attackers)?
The server header reveals information about the software (and its version) running on a server. If an outdated version of a software is used, researchers 
or potential attackers can check the vulnerabilities associated with it.
