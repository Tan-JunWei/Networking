Step 2 - Basic filtering
6. 138 packets were captured overall
7. http
8. 2
9. ip.addr == 192.168.0.25
10. ip.src== 192.168.0.25 && http

Step 3 - Looking for data
11. The client and the server each sent 1 message.
12. From the response header, I can find out that the server is ECAcc (lac/55B8). Both the server type and version can be deduced.
